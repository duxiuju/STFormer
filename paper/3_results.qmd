## Robust cross-cohort concordance of WSI-inferred transcriptomes

We first evaluated gene-wise concordance between inferred and measured spatial transcriptomics in internal and external settings. In the external cohort, the global correlation distribution remained shifted toward positive agreement, indicating that the model generalizes beyond the training-like internal samples.

Within the internal validation setting, per-sample correlation profiles showed consistent performance across patients, with expected heterogeneity in difficulty across tissue contexts.

Together, these results support stable transfer of histology-derived molecular signal and suggest that performance differences are driven more by sample complexity than by systematic model collapse.

## Quantitative benchmarking supports model-level separation

To quantify practical utility, we summarized target-gene coverage and threshold-based concordance metrics. In the internal 14-CRC setting, the leading method shows higher central tendency and a larger fraction of genes exceeding moderate-to-high correlation cutoffs, consistent with distributional trends in Fig. @fig-corr-internal-sample.

External summaries recapitulated this ranking, supporting model robustness under distribution shift and independent sample characteristics.

## Clinical and biological context of inferred expression

Clinical composition across cohorts (dataset source, localization, and spot-level sequencing depth surrogates) provides context for the observed variation in model behavior.

At the gene level, top-ranked concordant genes remained biologically coherent across internal and external sets, indicating that recovered signals are not dominated by idiosyncratic sample artifacts.

Collectively, these analyses indicate that WSI-inferred ST captures reproducible transcriptomic structure across datasets while preserving biologically interpretable gene-level patterns.
