# Methods

## Study Design
We analyzed internal leave-one-patient-out data and external colorectal datasets, using measured ST as reference and model-inferred ST as prediction.

## Computational Workflow
The repository pipeline follows ordered scripts:
1. `1_Correlation_0705_Parallel.R`: computes correlation outputs.
2. `2-Prepare_gt_pre_csv_for_newh5_Parallel.R`: prepares matched GT/prediction matrices.
3. `3_newh5_from_csv_0707_Parallel.R`: builds intermediate `newh5` assets.
4. `4_spe_from_newh5.R`: constructs `SpatialExperiment` objects and visualization outputs.
5. `5_three_line_Table.R`: exports summary tables and top-gene reports.

## Metrics and Reporting
Primary endpoint: gene-wise spot-level correlation between inferred and measured ST. We report median/mean correlation and the proportion of genes above thresholds (0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50).

## Statistical Notes
Results are descriptive and benchmark-oriented; figures summarize distributional trends across genes and samples.
