# Abstract

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides an interpretable molecular readout of tissue architecture, yet its clinical scalability is constrained by cost and tissue requirements. We developed and benchmarked a whole-slide-image (WSI)-to-ST inference framework across internal leave-one-patient-out cohorts and external datasets in colorectal cancer. Across 418 target genes, the framework achieved robust spot-level concordance with measured ST profiles and preserved biologically meaningful spatial gradients. Comparative evaluation against multiple state-of-the-art baselines showed consistently stronger correlation distributions and a higher fraction of genes above practical concordance thresholds. These findings indicate that histology-driven virtual ST can recover substantial transcriptomic structure from routine pathology images and may support hypothesis generation in settings where direct ST is unavailable.
