# Discussion

The present analysis demonstrates that virtual ST from WSIs can reach reproducible concordance across both internal and external colorectal datasets, with a clear advantage for the top-performing model in this benchmark. Importantly, improvements were not restricted to a few marker genes but extended to distribution-level shifts in per-gene correlations and threshold-based quality metrics.

Several limitations remain. First, performance still varies by sample and tissue context, suggesting unresolved domain shifts in staining, cellular composition, or section quality. Second, correlation-based metrics do not fully capture pathway-level conservation or downstream clinical utility. Third, retrospective evaluation cannot substitute prospective deployment constraints.

Future work should include prospective multi-center validation, uncertainty-aware calibration at spot level, and integration with pathology annotation priors to improve robustness in low-signal regions.
