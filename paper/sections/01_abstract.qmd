# Abstract

- Background: Predicting spatial transcriptomics from pathology images remains challenging across cohorts.
- Objective: Evaluate STFormer for robust cross-sample and cross-dataset performance.
- Methods: Train and test with standardized preprocessing, paired image-gene tiles, and benchmark baselines.
- Results: Report correlation-based metrics, gene-level performance, and qualitative spatial patterns.
- Conclusion: Summarize practical value, key limitations, and next validation steps.
